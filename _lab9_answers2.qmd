# Part 1: Analysis of overall survival in the Worcester Heart Attack study

```{r}
library(haven)   # for reading SPSS files
library(dplyr)   # for data manipulation
library(survival)  # for performing survival analysis

# Load the dataset
whas500 <- read_sav("datasets/whas500.sav")

# Convert labeled variables to factors
whas500 <- whas500 %>%
  mutate(across(where(is.labelled), as_factor))

# Create a numerical variable for follow-up status (1 = dead, 0 = censored)

```

## Association between MI order and overall survival

### Kaplan-Meier survival curves and logrank test

```{r}
# Kaplan-Meier by MI order
group_fit <- survfit(Surv(lenfol, fstat_numeric) ~ miord, data = whas500)
summary(group_fit)

plot(group_fit, col = c("blue", "red"), xlab = "Follow-up Time (days)", ylab = "Survival Probability", main = "Survival by MI Order")
legend("topleft", legend = c("First MI", "Recurrent MI"), col = c("blue", "red"), lty = 1)
```

::: {.callout-important icon=false title="Question 1"}
Based on the Kaplan-Meier table, what are the estimated survival probabilities at 3 years for patients with a first MI and those with a recurrent MI?
:::

::: {.callout-tip icon=false title="Answer question 1"}
3 years is equal to 3 * 365 = 1095 days. The estimated survival probabilities at 3 years can be read of the Kaplan-Meier table by finding the closest time point less than or equal to 1095 days for each group. This gives an estimated survival probability of 0.651 for patients with a first MI and 0.546 for patients with a recurrent MI.
:::

::: {.callout-important icon=false title="Question 2"}
Based on the Kaplan-Meier curves, do you observe any differences in survival times between patients with a first MI and those with a recurrent MI?  
:::

::: {.callout-tip icon=false title="Answer question 2"}
The Kaplan-Meier curves suggest that patients with a recurrent MI have lower survival probabilities compared to those with a first MI. This indicates a potential difference in survival times between the two groups.
:::

To formally test the difference in survival between the two groups, we can use the logrank test:

```{r}
# Logrank test
survdiff(Surv(lenfol, fstat_numeric) ~ miord, data = whas500)
```

::: {.callout-important icon=false title="Question 3"}
Based on the results of the logrank test, is there a significant difference in overall survival between patients with a first MI and those with a recurrent MI?
:::

::: {.callout-tip icon=false title="Answer question 3"}
The p-value from the logrank test is a measure of the evidence against the null hypothesis of no difference in survival between the two groups. A small p-value (typically < 0.05) indicates that there is sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant difference in survival between the groups. In this case, the p-value of 0.002 is less than 0.05, suggesting a significant difference in overall survival between patients with a first MI and those with a recurrent MI.
:::

### Cox regression

```{r}
# Unadjusted Cox regression
coxph_model_unadj <- coxph(Surv(lenfol, fstat_numeric) ~ miord, data = whas500)
summary(coxph_model_unadj)
```

::: {.callout-important icon=false title="Question 4"}
What is the hazard ratio (HR) for patients with a recurrent MI compared to those with a first MI based on the unadjusted Cox regression model?
:::

::: {.callout-tip icon=false title="Answer question 4"}
The HR for patients with a recurrent MI compared to those with a first MI is 1.53 based on the unadjusted Cox regression model. This means that patients with a recurrent MI have a 53% higher risk of death compared to patients with a first MI.
:::

::: {.callout-important icon=false title="Question 5"}
Does the result of the Cox regression model support the findings from the logrank test regarding the association between MI order and overall survival?
:::

::: {.callout-tip icon=false title="Answer question 5"}
The p-value associated with the miord variable in the Cox regression model is 0.002, which is consistent with the result of the logrank test. Both tests provide evidence of a significant association between MI order and overall survival, indicating that patients with a recurrent MI have a higher risk of death compared to those with a first MI.
:::

```{r}
# Adjusted Cox regression
coxph_model_adj <- coxph(Surv(lenfol, fstat_numeric) ~ miord + age + gender, data = whas500)
summary(coxph_model_adj)
```

::: {.callout-important icon=false title="Question 6"}
After adjusting for age and gender, what is the hazard ratio (HR) for patients with a recurrent MI compared to those with a first MI? How does this compare to the unadjusted HR? Can you explain the change in the HR after adjusting for these variables?
:::

::: {.callout-tip icon=false title="Answer question 6"}
After adjusting for gender and age, the HR for patients with a recurrent MI compared to those with a first MI is 1.21, with a corresponding p-value of 0.177. This adjusted HR is lower than the unadjusted HR of 1.53. The change in the HR after adjusting for these variables suggests that gender and age may confound the association between MI order and overall survival. In this case, the mean age of patients with a recurrent MI (`r round(mean(whas500$age[whas500$miord=="recurrent"], na.rm=T), 1)`) is higher than that of patients with a first MI (`r round(mean(whas500$age[whas500$miord=="first"], na.rm=T), 1)`), which could explain the change in the HR after adjusting for age.

# Part 2: Unguided exercises

### Excercise 1

File `Ex9_1.sav` (available on Brightspace) contains data from a small experiment concerning motion sickness at sea (Burns, 1984). Subjects were placed in a cabin subjected to vertical motion for two hours. The outcome variable was the waiting time to emesis (vomiting). Some subjects requested an early stop to the experiment although they had not vomited, yielding censored observations, while others successfully survived two hours. The experiment was carried out with two "treatments": two combinations of movement accelerations and frequency. One combination was used for a group of 21 subjects, the other in a different group of 28 subjects.

```{r}
#| echo: true

ex9 <- read_sav("datasets/Ex9_1.sav")

# Convert labeled variables to factors
ex9 <- ex9 %>%
  mutate(across(where(is.labelled), as_factor))

# Create a numerical variable for follow-up status (1 = exact, 0 = censored)
ex9$event_numeric <- ifelse(ex9$censor=="exact", 1, 0)
```

(a) Calculate and plot Kaplan-Meier estimates of survival probabilities in the two groups.

```{r}
group_fit <- survfit(Surv(stime, event_numeric) ~ expgroup, data = ex9)
summary(group_fit)

plot(group_fit, col = c("blue", "red"), xlab = "Follow-up Time (minutes)", ylab = "Survival Probability", main = NULL)
legend("bottomleft", legend = c("freq=0.167 Hz, 0.111 G", "0.333 Hz, 0.222 G"), col = c("blue", "red"), lty = 1)
```  

(b) Calculate the 95% CI for the difference between survival probabilities of the two groups after 60 minutes.

According to the previously obtained Kaplan-Meier estimates, the survival probabilities (standard errors) at 60 minutes are 0.854 (0.0778) for the first group and 0.816 (0.0744) for the second group. The estimated difference in survival probabilities is therefore $0.854 - 0.816 = 0.038$. The standard error of the difference is calculated as the square root of the sum of the squared standard errors for each group: $\sqrt{0.0778^2 + 0.0744^2} = 0.108$.

The 95% CI for the difference in survival probabilities after 60 minutes is $0.038 \pm 1.96 \times 0.108 = [-0.174, 0.250]$.

(c) Compare the two survival curves by logrank test.

```{r}
logrank_test <- survdiff(Surv(stime, event_numeric) ~ expgroup, data = ex9)
logrank_test
```

The p-value from the logrank test (0.07) is larger than 0.05, suggesting that there is no significant difference in survival probabilities between the two groups.

(d) Use Cox regression to compare the two treatments; compare the result to that of the logrank test; calculate the hazard ratio and its 95% CI.

```{r}
coxph_model <- coxph(Surv(stime, event_numeric) ~ expgroup, data = ex9)
summary(coxph_model)
```

The p-value associated with the `expgroup` variable in the Cox regression model is 0.083, which is consistent with the result of the logrank test. The hazard ratio for the second group compared to the first group is 2.470, with a 95% CI of [0.889, 6.862].

(e) Two different persons undergo the experiment with different treatments. Estimate the probability that the waiting time until emesis under one of the treatments exceeds that under the other treatment.

The probability that the waiting time is shorter under the frequency 0.33 than under the frequency 0.167 is estimated as $2.47/(1+2.47)=0.71$. (calculated using the formula under additional remark 2 in the syllabus).

### Exercise 2

Subfertile women with a child wish may receive an in-vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment. In an observational study the waiting time until pregnancy was recorded. The women undergoing the IVF treatment were categorized (prior to the start of the treatment) in four groups, A, B, C and D, with respect to the type of infertility. The waiting times – some of them censored - of the groups were compared by means of Cox regression with the group variable entered as a categorical variable. The P-value of the Wald test with 3 df was 0.095. The dummy-variables v1, v2 and v3 were defined as follows:

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false

knitr::include_graphics("images/ch9-img-2.png")
```

The hazard ratios and P-values for the dummy variables v1, v2 and v3 were reported as 1.20 (P=0.30), 2.80 (P=0.02) and 1.05 (P=0.48).

(a) Which group is estimated to have the longest waiting time for pregnancy?

A HR greater than 1 corresponds to a shorter waiting time. (The event in this exercise is "getting pregnant". A larger hazard means a shorter waiting time). The HR’s of A:D, B:D and C:D all exceed 1, and so D has the longest waiting time.

(b) A researcher compared all pairs of groups by separate tests. She used the Bonferroni method to keep the type-I error of the entire procedure below 10%. Which differences were found to be significant?

There are 6 paired comparisons. Thus the Bonferroni corrected P-values are obtained by multiplying the separate P-values by 6. Although not all 6 pairwise P-values are listed, the largest possible HR, 2.8, has a P-value of 0.02, that is 0.12 when corrected. As all the other pairwise p-values are larger, none of the pairwise differences is significant at 5% level.

(c) Which assumptions are needed for the validity of Cox regression in this case?

Non-informative censoring and proportionality of hazard functions

### Exercise 3

Relation between survival and a number of variables was studied in 37 patients having a bone marrow transplant. Cox regression analysis using the occurrence of acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD=1 if present and GvHD=0 if absent), diagnosis, recipient’s age and sex, donor’s age and sex, whether the donor had been pregnant and the type of the leukemia (CML=1 if chronic myeloid leukemia and CML=0 otherwise) yielded the following model:

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false

knitr::include_graphics("images/ch9-img-3.png")
```

(a) What is the interpretation of the opposite signs for the regression coefficients?

The opposite signs mean that high values of one variable and low values of the other variable are associated with an increased risk of dying. A positive regression coefficient means that high values of that variable are associated with worse survival, and conversely for a negative coefficient. Thus the model predicts that survival is worse for non-CML patients and those with GvHD.

(b) Calculate the relative risks of dying (hazard ratio) for the following patients relative to non-GvHD non-CML patients (i) with GvHD but not CML, (ii) CML but without GvHD, (iii) CML and GvHD.

We need to calculate the linear predictor for each group of patients. These are as follows:

-   non-GvHD & non-CML (reference): 0.000
-   GvHD & non-CML: 2.306
-   non-GvHD & CML: -2.508
-   GvHD & CML: 2.306 + -2.508 = -0.202

The relative risks of dying in the other groups relative to non-GvHD non-CML patients are as follows:

-   GvHD & non-CML $\exp(2.306) = 10.03$
-   non-GvHD & CML $\exp(-2.508) = 0.08$
-   GvHD & CML $\exp(-0.202) = 0.82$
