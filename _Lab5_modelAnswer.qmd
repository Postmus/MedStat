## Introduction

Welcome to lab 5 in the Medical Statistics course. In this lab, you will combine your learnings from the previous lectures and labs in part I of the course to address the following research questions:

* Does maximum heart rate achieved differ across chest pain types?
* Is the presence of heart disease associated with sex or fasting blood sugar?

## Dataset description

The Cleveland heart disease dataset originates from the Cleveland Clinic Foundation and focuses on heart disease diagnosis. It includes data from 303 patients on the following variables:

* `age`: Age in years
* `sex`: Sex (1 = female; 2 = male)
* `cp`: Chest pain type (1 = typical angina; 2 = atypical angina; 3 = non-anginal pain; 4 = asymptomatic)
* `trestbps`: Resting blood pressure (mm Hg at hospital admission)
* `chol`: Serum cholesterol in mg/dl
* `fbs`: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
* `restecg`: Resting electrocardiographic results (1 = normal; 2 = ST-T wave abnormality; 3 = left ventricular hypertrophy)
* `thalach`: Maximum heart rate achieved
* `exang`: Exercise-induced angina (1 = no; 2 = yes)
* `oldpeak`: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
* `slope`: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment (1 = upsloping; 2 = flat; 3 = downsloping)
* `ca`: Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy
* `thal`: Thallium heart scan results (1 = normal; 2 = fixed defect; 3 = reversible defect)
* `target`: Diagnosis of heart disease (1 = heart disease; 2 = no heart disease)

## Steps to complete the assignment

### **Step 1:** Create an individualized dataset

```{r}
#| include: false

# Load the required libraries
library(haven)
library(dplyr)

# Load the SPSS file
heart_data <- read_sav("datasets/heart_disease_cleveland.sav")

# Convert all variables to factors where needed
heart_data <- heart_data %>% mutate(across(where(is.labelled), as_factor))
```

### **Step 2:** Create a baseline characteristics table

* Include all variables in the dataset apart from the outcome variable `target`
  - Summarize demographic variables (e.g., `age`, `sex`)
  - Summarize clinical variables (e.g., `chol`, `trestbps`, `thalach`, `cp`)

* Decide on suitable summary measures for each variable
  - Use appropriate measures for continuous variables (e.g., mean, standard deviation, median, interquartile range)
  - Use frequency counts and percentages for categorical variables

* Present your table clearly
  - Use meaningful labels, headings, and clear formatting
  
```{r}  
library(tableone) # for creating baseline characteristics table
library(knitr) # for rendering tables
library(labelled) # for setting variable labels

library(ggplot2) # for creating plots
library(gridExtra) # for arranging plots

# Customize variable labels
heart_data <- heart_data %>%
  set_variable_labels(
    age = "Age (years)",
    sex = "Sex",
    cp = "Chest Pain Type",
    trestbps = "Resting Blood Pressure (mmHg)",
    chol = "Cholesterol (mg/dL)",
    fbs = "Fasting Blood Sugar",
    restecg = "Resting ECG Results",
    thalach = "Max Heart Rate Achieved",
    exang = "Exercise-Induced Angina",
    oldpeak = "ST Depression",
    slope = "Slope of ST Segment",
    ca = "Number of Major Vessels",
    thal = "Thalassemia Type",
    target = "Heart Disease Status"
  )

# Define categorical variables
categorical_vars <- c("sex", "cp", "fbs", "restecg", "exang", "slope", "ca", "thal")
continuous_vars <- c("age", "trestbps", "chol", "thalach", "oldpeak")

# Define all variables for the table
all_vars <- c(continuous_vars, categorical_vars)

# Create the table
table1 <- CreateTableOne(vars = all_vars, 
                         data = heart_data, 
                         factorVars = categorical_vars)

# Create histograms for continuous variables
histograms <- lapply(heart_data[continuous_vars], 
  function(x) ggplot(heart_data, aes(x = x)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins = 20) +
  theme_minimal())
grid.arrange(grobs = histograms, ncol = 2)

# Render the table with knitr::kable
kable(print(table1, nonnormal = c("oldpeak"), varLabels = TRUE, printToggle = FALSE))
```
  
### **Step 3:** Perform the analysis for the first research question

**Research Question**: *Does maximum heart rate achieved differ across chest pain types?*

* Visualize the data
  - Create a boxplot to compare the distribution of maximum heart rate achieved across the four chest pain types

```{r}  
# Create a boxplot to compare the distribution of maximum heart rate achieved across the four chest pain types
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(heart_data, aes(x = factor(cp), y = thalach)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Chest pain type", y = "Maximum heart rate achieved") +
  theme_minimal()
```

* Calculate the estimated population means and 95% confidence intervals for maximum heart rate achieved for each of the four chest pain types

```{r}
# Calculate the estimated population means and 95% confidence intervals for maximum heart rate achieved for each of the four chest pain types
for (i in levels(heart_data$cp)) {
  mean_thalach <- mean(heart_data$thalach[heart_data$cp == i], na.rm = TRUE)
  se_thalach <- sd(heart_data$thalach[heart_data$cp == i], na.rm = TRUE) / sqrt(sum(heart_data$cp == i, na.rm = TRUE))
  ci_thalach <- qt(0.975, sum(heart_data$cp == i, na.rm = TRUE) - 1) * se_thalach
  cat(paste("Chest pain type", i, ": Mean = ", round(mean_thalach, 2), ", 95% CI = (", round(mean_thalach - ci_thalach, 2), ", ", round(mean_thalach + ci_thalach, 2), ")\n"))
}
```

* Select and perform an appropriate test
  - Use one-way ANOVA if normality and equal variances are met
  - Use Kruskal-Wallis test if assumptions are violated
  - Perform post-hoc comparisons using Bonferroni adjusted p-values if significant differences are found

```{r}
# Create histograms of maximum heart rate achieved for each chest pain type
ggplot(heart_data, aes(x = thalach, fill = factor(cp))) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 20, alpha = 0.5) +
  facet_wrap(~ cp) +
  labs(x = "Maximum heart rate achieved", y = "Frequency", fill = "Chest pain type") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

# Perform levene's test for homogeneity of variances
library(car)
leveneTest(heart_data$thalach ~ heart_data$cp) # variances are equal
```

#### one-way ANOVA

```{r}
# Perform one-way ANOVA
anova_thalach <- aov(thalach ~ cp, data = heart_data)
summary(anova_thalach)

# Perform post-hoc comparisons using Bonferroni adjusted p-values
pairwise.t.test(heart_data$thalach, heart_data$cp, p.adj = "bonferroni")
```
  
#### Kruskal-Wallis test

```{r}
# Perform Kruskal-Wallis test
kruskal.test(heart_data$thalach ~ heart_data$cp)

# Perform post-hoc comparisons using pairwise Wilcoxon tests
pairwise.wilcox.test(heart_data$thalach, heart_data$cp, p.adjust.method = "bonferroni")

# Perform post-hoc comparisons using Dunn's test
library(dunn.test)
dunn.test(heart_data$thalach, heart_data$cp, method = "bonferroni", altp = TRUE)
```
  
  
### **Step 4:** Perform the analysis for the second research question

**Research Question**: *Is the presence of heart disease associated with sex or fasting blood sugar?*

* Summarize the data
  - Calculate and report the prevalence of heart disease for each group within sex and fasting blood sugar
  - Include percentages and 95% confidence intervals for each group
* Select and perform an appropriate test
  - Use a Chi-Square test of homogeneity or Fisherâ€™s Exact Test, depending on the expected cell counts

#### Association between heart disease and sex

![95% CIs using the 0/1 recoded variable (1 = heart disease; 0 = no heart disease)](images/SPSS_transformed.PNG)

```{r}
table(heart_data$sex, heart_data$target)

# Calculate and report the prevalence of heart disease for sex
prop.table(table(heart_data$sex, heart_data$target), margin = 1)

# Calculate and report the prevalence of heart disease for sex
prop.table(table(heart_data$sex, heart_data$target))
```

```{r}
# Perform a chi-square test of homogeneity
chisq.test(table(heart_data$sex, heart_data$target))

# Retrieve expected cell counts
chisq.test(table(heart_data$sex, heart_data$target))$expected
```  

#### Association between heart disease and fasting blood sugar

```{r}
# Construct contingency table
table(heart_data$fbs, heart_data$target)

# Calculate and report the prevalence of heart disease for fasting blood sugar
prop.table(table(heart_data$fbs, heart_data$target), margin = 1)

# Perform a chi-square test of homogeneity
chisq.test(table(heart_data$fbs, heart_data$target))

# Retrieve expected cell counts
chisq.test(table(heart_data$fbs, heart_data$target))$expected
```
