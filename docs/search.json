For example, if we have 10 patients and we want to know the probability that exactly 3 of them respond to a given treatment, where the response rate is known to be 40%, we can use SPSS to calculate this probability.\nTo perform this calculation in SPSS, go to “Transform &gt; Compute Variable…” and create a new variable called p_response_3. Use the function PDF.BINOM(x, n, p) to calculate the cumulative probability:\n\nx: The number of successes we are interested in (in this example, 3 patients responding).\nn: The number of trials (in this example, 10 patients).\np: The probability of success in each trial (in this example, 0.4 or 40% response rate).\n\nCumulative probabilities, such as the probability that 3 or fewer patients out of 10 respond to the treatment, can similarly be calculated by creating a new variable with the CDF.BINOM(x, n, p) function.\nNote: Unlike other statistical software, SPSS requires that calculations performed using the “Transform &gt; Compute Variable…” tool always have a target variable specified. This means you cannot perform calculations without creating an output variable in your dataset, which can make one-time calculations cumbersome. This is a limitation of SPSS, especially when you just want to explore different scenarios without cluttering your dataset with temporary variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 5\n\n\n\nThe probability of being blood group B is 0.08.
