Test the null hypothesis that 50% of the Dutch adolescents drink alcohol, using a significance level of 5%.\nHint: to perform this test in SPSS, we need to create a new dataset containing the above observations. To achieve this, construct a new data file containing two variables, like this:\n\n\n\nAlcohol\nnumber\n\n\n\n\n1\n128\n\n\n0\n72\n\n\n\nThen, instruct SPSS to weight the categories (Alcohol) by “number” via Data → Weight cases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 11\n\n\n\nRather than using an exact binomial test, we can also use the normal approximation of the binomial distribution to obtain an approximate p-value for the above hypothesis test.

Is the use of the normal approximation appropriate in this case?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDifferences in Two-Sided P-Value Calculation Between SPSS and R\n\n\n\nWhen conducting statistical tests, it is important to understand that different software packages can calculate two-sided p-values in slightly different ways, which may lead to variations in results. A key difference exists between how SPSS and base R handle this calculation:\n\nSPSS often calculates two-sided p-values by doubling the one-sided p-value. Specifically, SPSS determines the probability of the observed outcome in one direction (greater or less than a given value) and then multiplies this value by 2. This approach assumes that the distribution of the test statistic is symmetric under the null hypothesis. While this method is straightforward, it can be misleading if the distribution is skewed or the sample size is small, as it may not fully account for the asymmetry in the data.\nBase R (e.g., the binom.test() function) uses a more exact method for calculating two-sided p-values. R’s approach sums the probabilities of observing outcomes that are as extreme as, or more extreme than, the observed value in both directions (both tails of the distribution). This method does not assume symmetry and provides a more accurate p-value, particularly for small samples or skewed distributions."

Is the use of the normal approximation appropriate in this case?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer question 11\n\n\n\nTo manually calculate an approximate p-value using the normal approximation, we first calculate the sample proportion \\(p\\) as the number of successes divided by the total number of trials (i.e., \\(p\\) = 128 / 200 = 0.64). We then calculate the standard error (SE) as \\(\\sqrt(\\pi * (1 - \\pi) / n)\\), where \\(n\\) is the total number of observations and \\(\\pi\\) is the null hypothesis proportion. This gives a SE of 0.035.\nUnder the null hypothesis, the sample proportion is approximately Normally distributed with mean \\(\\pi\\) = 0.5 and SE = 0.035. To calculate the probability of observing a sample proportion at least as extreme as the one observed in the data, we can calculate the z-score as \\((p - \\pi) / SE\\). In this case, the z-score is 3.96, resulting in a p-value &lt;0.001, which is consistent with the p-value obtained from the binomial test.\nThe use of the normal approximation is very reasonable in this case because \\(n * \\pi = 200 * 0.5 =100\\) is considerably larger than 5, which is the minimum requirement for the normal approximation to be valid."

What is the probability that if 500 ml of blood is taken from each of 100 unrelated blood donors fewer than 1,500 ml of group B blood will be obtained?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer question 5\n\n\n\nIf we let the random variable X denote the number of blood donors of blood group B, it follows from the text in the exercise that X ~ Bin(0.08, 100). Fewer than 1,500 ml of group B blood will be obtained if X is equal to or smaller than 2. We can therefore answer this question by calculating \\(P(X \\leq 2)\\) using the cumulative distribution function of the binomial distribution, which gives a probability of 0.01 or 1%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 6\n\n\n\nIn a clinical trial in which a total of 100 patients are allocated to two treatments A and B by simple randomization (tossing a coin for each new patient). What is the probability that the difference between the numbers of patients in the two treatment groups exceeds 20? (Hint: the number of individuals in one treatment group (for example A) follows a Binomial distribution).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer question 6\n\n\n\nIf we let the random variable X denote the number of individuals in treatment group A, we get a difference between the number of patients in the two treatment groups of over 20 if \\(X &lt; 40\\) or if \\(X &gt; 60\\). Using the cumulative distribution function of the binomial distribution, these probabilities are equal to \\(P(X &lt; 40) = 0.0176\\) and \\(P(X &gt; 60) = 1 - P(X \\leq 60) = 0.0176\\). The probability that the difference between the number of patients in the two treatment groups exceeds 20 is therefore equal to 2*0.0176 = 0.035 or 3.5%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 7\n\n\n\nOver a 25 year period the mean height of adult males increased from 175.8 cm to 179.1 cm, but the standard deviation stayed at 5.84 cm. The minimum height requirement for men to join the police force is 172 cm. What proportion of men would be too short to become policemen at the beginning and end of the 25 year period, assuming that the height of adult males has a Normal distribution?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer question 7\n\n\n\nAt the start, the minimum height was \\((172 - 175.8) / 5.84 = -0.65\\) standard deviations from the mean. From the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution, the proportion of men smaller than this would be about \\(26\\%\\). At the end of the \\(25\\)-year period, the minimum height was \\((172 - 179.1) / 5.84 = -1.22\\) standard deviations from the mean. From the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution, the proportion of men below the minimum is now about \\(11\\%\\). Thus, the proportion of ineligible men has more than halved.\n\n\n\n\nPart 3 - Some conceptual questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 8\n\n\n\nImagine we have some observations on blood pressure and calculate the mean, standard deviation, median and IQR. How do these measures change if all observations are\n\nincreased by 10\ndecreased by their mean\nmultiplied by 10\ndivided by their standard deviation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer question 8\n\n\n\n\nStandard deviation and IQR remain the same, mean and median increase by 10.\nStandard deviation and IQR remain the same, mean and median decrease by the mean (the mean becomes zero).\nAll are multiplied by 10.\nAll are divided by standard deviation; the standard deviation becomes one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 9\n\n\n\nTwo fair dice are rolled, the results are X1 and X2.\n\nWhat is the probability Prob(X1=X2)?\nWhat is the expected value E(X1), and the standard deviation SD(X1)?\nGive the expected value and the variance of X1+X2 and of X1-X2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer question 9\n\n\n\nQuestion (a)\nAssume the dice have different colors, red (R) and blue (B). \\(P(R = 1) = \\frac{1}{6}\\), \\(P(R = 2) = \\frac{1}{6}\\), etc. The outcomes of Red and Blue are independent of each other. So for example: \\(P(R = 1 \\text{ and } B = 4) = P(R = 1) \\times P(B = 4) = \\frac{1}{6} \\times \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{1}{36}\\).\nThis is true for all possible combinations of outcomes. There are only \\(6\\) possible outcomes with equal results: \\(R = 1\\) and \\(B = 1\\), \\(R = 2\\) and \\(B = 2\\), and so on. In total: \\(\\text{Prob} = 6 \\cdot (\\frac{1}{6} \\cdot \\frac{1}{6}) = 6 \\times \\frac{1}{36} = \\frac{1}{6}\\).\nQuestion (b)\nUsing the formula on page 3.3 of the syllabus:\n\\(E(X_1) = \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6) = 3.5\\)\n\\(\\text{Var}(X_1) = \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot [(1 - 3.5)^2 + (2 - 3.5)^2 + \\ldots] = 2.92\\)\n\\(\\text{SD} = \\sqrt{2.92} = 1.71\\)\nQuestion (c) Using the calculation rules on page 3.5 of the syllabus:\n\\(E(X_1 + X_2) = E(X_1) + E(X_2) = 3.5 + 3.5 = 7\\)\n\\(\\text{Var}(X_1 + X_2) = 2.92 + 2.92 = 5.84\\)\n\\(E(X_1 - X_2) = 0\\)\n\\(\\text{Var}(X_1 - X_2) = 2.92 + 2.92 = 5.84\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 10\n\n\n\nThere are two hospitals in town. On average 45 deliveries take place each day in the larger hospital, and 15 in the smaller. The probability of a baby being a boy is about 0.52, and the probability of twins is about 0.012. On any day, which hospital is more likely\n\nto have a set of twins delivered\nto have more than 60 % of babies being boys?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer question 10\n\n\n\n\nThe larger hospital, simply because there are more births. (This question is about an absolute number: a set of twins).\nThe day-to-day variation in the proportion of boys will be greater in the smaller hospital, so it is more likely to have more than 60% of babies being boys on any day. (This question is about a relative number: 60% of the babies).\n\nTo make the differences more clear: consider a very small hospital (only one delivery per day) and a very large hospital (1000 deliveries a day).\n\nThe probability that the delivery in the small hospital will concern twins equals 0.012. The same is true for each delivery in the larger hospital, but since we have 1000 deliveries, we expect 12 of them to concern twins.\nIn the small hospital, the probability that the child is a boy is 0.52. If a boy is born, then 100% of the babies that day are boys. This will happen in 52% of the days. For the larger hospital, we expect to see 520 boys and 480 girls on an arbitrary day. Some days there will be more than 520 boys, and other days there will be fewer. However, the probability that more than 60% of the children (more than 600 out of 1000) will be boys is very small—for sure less than 0.52.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 11\n\n\n\nThe probability of a baby being a boy is 0.52. For six women delivering consecutively in the same labour ward on one day, which of the following exact sequences of boys and girls is most likely and which least likely?\nGBGBGB\nBBBGGG\nGBBBBB\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer question 11\n\n\n\nAs the probability of a boy is slightly greater than the probability of a girl, the sequence with the most boys is most likely, which is the last sequence. The other two sequences are equally likely."

The minimum height requirement for men to join the police force is 172 cm. What proportion of men would be too short to become policemen at the beginning and end of the 25 year period, assuming that the height of adult males has a Normal distribution?"
