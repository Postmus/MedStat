## Introduction

Welcome to lab 5 in the Medical Statistics course. In this lab, you will combine your learnings from the previous lectures and labs in part I of the course to address the following research questions:

* Does maximum heart rate achieved differ across chest pain types?
* Is the presence of heart disease associated with sex or fasting blood sugar?

## Dataset description

The Cleveland heart disease dataset originates from the Cleveland Clinic Foundation and focuses on heart disease diagnosis. It includes data from 303 patients on the following variables:

* `age`: Age in years
* `sex`: Sex (1 = female; 2 = male)
* `cp`: Chest pain type (1 = typical angina; 2 = atypical angina; 3 = non-anginal pain; 4 = asymptomatic)
* `trestbps`: Resting blood pressure (mm Hg at hospital admission)
* `chol`: Serum cholesterol in mg/dl
* `fbs`: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
* `restecg`: Resting electrocardiographic results (1 = normal; 2 = ST-T wave abnormality; 3 = left ventricular hypertrophy)
* `thalach`: Maximum heart rate achieved
* `exang`: Exercise-induced angina (1 = no; 2 = yes)
* `oldpeak`: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
* `slope`: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment (1 = upsloping; 2 = flat; 3 = downsloping)
* `ca`: Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy
* `thal`: Thallium heart scan results (1 = normal; 2 = fixed defect; 3 = reversible defect)
* `target`: Diagnosis of heart disease (1 = heart disease; 2 = no heart disease)

## Steps to complete the lab

### **Step 1:** Download and load/open the dataset

Download the Cleveland heart disease dataset (heart_disease_cleveland.sav) from the Datasets menu. SPSS users can simply double click on the downloaded file to open the dataset. R users can follow the instructions below to load and clean the dataset:

```{r}
# Load the required libraries
library(haven)
library(dplyr)

# Load the SPSS file
heart_data <- read_sav("heart_disease_cleveland.sav")

# Convert all variables to factors where needed
heart_data <- heart_data %>% mutate(across(where(is.labelled), as_factor))
```

### **Step 2:** Create a baseline characteristics table

* Include all variables in the dataset apart from the outcome variable `target`
  - Summarize demographic variables (e.g., `age`, `sex`)
  - Summarize clinical variables (e.g., `chol`, `trestbps`, `thalach`, `cp`)

* Decide on suitable summary measures for each variable
  - Use appropriate measures for continuous variables (e.g., mean, standard deviation, median, interquartile range)
  - Use frequency counts and percentages for categorical variables
  
### **Step 3:** Perform the analysis for the first research question

**Research Question**: *Does maximum heart rate achieved differ across chest pain types?*

* Visualize the data
  - Create a boxplot to compare the distribution of maximum heart rate achieved across the four chest pain types
* Calculate the estimated population means and 95% confidence intervals for maximum heart rate achieved for each of the four chest pain types
* Select and perform an appropriate test
  - Use one-way ANOVA if normality and equal variances are met
  - Use Kruskal-Wallis test if assumptions are violated
  - Perform post-hoc comparisons using Bonferroni adjusted p-values if significant differences are found

### **Step 4:** Perform the analysis for the second research question

**Research Question**: *Is the presence of heart disease associated with sex or fasting blood sugar?*

* Summarize the data
  - Calculate and report the prevalence of heart disease for each group within sex and fasting blood sugar
  - Include percentages and 95% confidence intervals for each group
* Select and perform an appropriate test
  - Use a Chi-Square test of homogeneity or Fisherâ€™s Exact Test, depending on the expected cell counts
