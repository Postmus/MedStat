## Introduction

This rubric is used to assess the second Medical Statistics assignment. The grade is based on three main parts (ANCOVA, Logistic Regression, Prediction Model) and a general section on data handling and reproducibility.

### Checklist-style scoring (applies to all criteria)

This rubric is intended to work like a checklist:

- **Excellent (10):** All required components are present and correct.
- **Good (8):** Everything essential is correct, with **one minor issue** (small omission, small reporting error, or slightly unclear wording that does not change the conclusion).
- **Sufficient (6):** Core idea is present, but there are **multiple minor issues** or **one major issue** (missing a required component, wrong model/test, or interpretation that could change the conclusion).
- **Insufficient (3):** Major parts are missing/incorrect, or results are not interpretable/gradable.

Use the checklists under each criterion to decide the level.

## Criterion 1: Part A - ANCOVA (30%)

Analysis of sex differences in resting blood pressure while adjusting for age.

**Required components (checklist):**

1. Fit an additive ANCOVA model with resting blood pressure as the outcome and age and sex as predictors.
2. Report the adjusted male-female difference in resting blood pressure with a **95% CI** and **p-value** (holding age constant).
3. Additive-model diagnostics included and correctly interpreted:
   - Q-Q plot
   - Residuals vs Fitted plot
4. Fit an interaction model (age by sex) and report the **Type III ANOVA** test for the age-by-sex interaction term.
5. Clear conclusion on (a) evidence for/against interaction and (b) whether the additive assumption is reasonable.

| Level | Score | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| Insufficient | 3 | One or more required components are missing, or the additive/interaction model is wrong, or the diagnostics/tests are misinterpreted. |
| Sufficient | 6 | Some required components are present, but there are multiple minor issues or one major issue (e.g., missing a required plot/test or unclear/incorrect conclusion). |
| Good | 8 | All required components are present with at most one minor issue (e.g., small reporting omission or slightly unclear interpretation). |
| Excellent | 10 | All required components are present and correct; reporting is clear and complete (estimate, 95% CI, p-value; correct use/interpretation of plots and Type III interaction test). |

## Criterion 2: Part B - Logistic Regression & DAG (30%)

Investigation of the causal effect of cholesterol on heart disease using a DAG for adjustment.

**Required components (checklist):**

1. Correct identification of the backdoor path(s) after removing arrows leaving cholesterol (the Week 8 "recipe").
2. Correct adjustment set for the **uncounfounded effect** of cholesterol on heart disease (given the provided DAG).
3. Unadjusted logistic regression model fit and reported: OR for cholesterol, **95% CI**, and interpretation.
4. Adjusted logistic regression model fit and reported using only the identified confounders: aOR, **95% CI**, and interpretation.
5. Side-by-side comparison of OR vs aOR (direction/magnitude of change + CI width) with a brief confounding explanation.

| Level | Score | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| Insufficient | 3 | One or more required components are missing, or the adjustment set is wrong, or ORs/models are wrong/misinterpreted. |
| Sufficient | 6 | Some required components are present, but there are multiple minor issues or one major issue (e.g., unclear DAG logic, weak/incorrect comparison). |
| Good | 8 | All required components are present with at most one minor issue (e.g., slight weakness in explanation or a small reporting omission). |
| Excellent | 10 | All required components are present and correct; DAG logic is clear; OR and aOR are correctly reported/interpreted with a clear confounding comparison. |

## Criterion 3: Part C - Prediction Model (30%)

Building a model for maximum heart rate using manual backward elimination.

**Required components (checklist):**

1. Start with the full model using the specified candidate predictors (age, sex, chest pain type, cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, and resting blood pressure) to predict maximum heart rate.
2. Manual backward elimination performed using **Type III ANOVA p-values** and the threshold **0.10**.
3. A clear removal-steps table (predictor removed + p-value at that step).
4. Final model includes only predictors with p < 0.10 (per Type III ANOVA) and is clearly stated.
5. Final model is reported with coefficients, **95% CIs**, and p-values (or equivalent output) and a short justification summary.

| Level | Score | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| Insufficient | 3 | One or more required components are missing, or backward elimination is not correctly performed (wrong p-values, wrong threshold, or wrong final model). |
| Sufficient | 6 | Some required components are present, but there are multiple minor issues or one major issue (e.g., incomplete documentation or inconsistent use of Type III ANOVA). |
| Good | 8 | All required components are present with at most one minor issue (e.g., a small reporting omission or slightly unclear step table). |
| Excellent | 10 | All required components are present and correct; the removal process is transparent and consistent with Type III p-values and the 0.10 threshold; final model reporting is complete. |

## Criterion 4: Data handling and reproducibility (10%)

**Required components (checklist):**

1. Analysis file is submitted and readable (R script or SPSS output/syntax) and matches the reported results.
2. Code/output is structured so results can be verified (data import, recoding, model fits, and plots/tables shown).
3. For R users: individualized 200-patient dataset is created correctly (same subset as Assignment 1; correct seed/sampling documented).

| Level | Score | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| Insufficient | 3 | One or more required components are missing, or results cannot be verified from the submitted script/output, or the dataset creation is wrong/undocumented (R users). |
| Sufficient | 6 | Some required components are present, but there are multiple minor issues or one major issue (e.g., omissions that make verification difficult). |
| Good | 8 | All required components are present with at most one minor issue (e.g., slight structure/clarity issues). |
| Excellent | 10 | All required components are present and correct; work is clearly structured and fully reproducible; dataset creation (R users) is correctly documented. |

## Grade calculation

Compute the final grade out of **10** as a weighted average of the four criterion scores:

Let A, B, C, and D be the scores (out of 10) for Part A, Part B, Part C, and Data handling and reproducibility, respectively.

Final grade = 0.30*A + 0.30*B + 0.30*C + 0.10*D.

| Criterion | Weight | Score | Weighted Score |
|-----------|--------|-------|----------------|
| Part A: ANCOVA | 30% | ___ | ___ |
| Part B: Logistic Regression & DAG | 30% | ___ | ___ |
| Part C: Prediction Model | 30% | ___ | ___ |
| Data handling and reproducibility | 10% | ___ | ___ |
| **Final Grade** | **100%** | | **___** |

### Example calculation

| Criterion | Weight | Score | Weighted Score |
|-----------|--------|-------|----------------|
| Part A: ANCOVA | 30% | 8 | 2.4 |
| Part B: Logistic Regression & DAG | 30% | 10 | 3.0 |
| Part C: Prediction Model | 30% | 6 | 1.8 |
| Data handling and reproducibility | 10% | 10 | 1.0 |
| **Final Grade** | **100%** | | **8.2** |
