## Criterion 1: Selection of statistical tests and summary statistics (40%)

| Level | Score | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| Insufficient | 3 | Tests are largely inappropriate; assumptions are ignored or misunderstood. Summary measures do not match variable types. |
| Sufficient | 6 | Tests are mostly correct but assumptions are not consistently checked or may be misapplied. Summary measures are mostly appropriate. |
| Good | 8 | All tests are correctly chosen with minor issues in assumption checking or interpretation. Summary measures match variable types and distributions. |
| Excellent | 10 | All tests are correctly chosen, and all relevant assumptions are appropriately checked and addressed. Appropriate post-hoc tests are selected when needed. Summary measures are well-chosen for variable types and distributions. |

## Criterion 2: Interpretation of results (30%)

| Level | Score | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| Insufficient | 3 | Results are largely misinterpreted, with major errors or irrelevant explanations. Confidence intervals are ignored or misunderstood. |
| Sufficient | 6 | Most results are interpreted correctly but explanations may be unclear or incomplete. Confidence intervals are reported but not always correctly interpreted. |
| Good | 8 | All results are interpreted correctly, with minor issues in clarity. Confidence intervals are used appropriately. |
| Excellent | 10 | All results are interpreted correctly, with clear and concise explanations that align with research questions. Confidence intervals are correctly interpreted. |

## Criterion 3: Presentation and reporting (20%)

| Level | Score | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| Insufficient | 3 | Presentation is disorganized or unprofessional, with major formatting or content issues. Test statistics are not properly reported. |
| Sufficient | 6 | Presentation is acceptable but inconsistent, with some formatting issues. Test statistics may be incomplete. |
| Good | 8 | Presentation is clear and professional overall, with minor issues in formatting. Most test statistics are correctly reported. |
| Excellent | 10 | Tables, figures, and text are highly professional, clear, and fully aligned with reporting guidelines. Test statistics are properly reported with appropriate detail. |

## Criterion 4: Data handling and reproducibility (10%)

| Level | Score | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| Insufficient | 3 | R script or SPSS output is incomplete or poorly structured. Individualized dataset is not correctly created (wrong seed or sampling) or cannot be verified. |
| Sufficient | 6 | R script or SPSS output is mostly complete but with omissions or unclear structure. Dataset creation steps may be unclear. |
| Good | 8 | R script or SPSS output is complete with minor documentation issues. Dataset is correctly created. |
| Excellent | 10 | R script or SPSS output is complete, logically structured, and allows full reproducibility. Individualized dataset is correctly created with proper seed and sampling, clearly documented. |
