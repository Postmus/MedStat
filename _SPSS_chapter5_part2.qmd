# Introduction

This set of guided exercises will help you work step-by-step through the statistical tests discussed in Sections 5.3 and 5.4 of Chapter 5. These exercises are designed to familiarize you with SPSS and guide you through the analysis process using a practical, hands-on approach. Each exercise corresponds to the methods introduced in Sections 5.3 and 5.4 and provides detailed instructions on how to perform these analyses in SPSS.

## Dataset Information

For these exercises, you will use the dataset `lowbwt.sav`, which you can download from Brightspace. This dataset contains information collected at Baystate Medical Center, Springfield MA, during 1986, and is from Appendix 1 of Hosmer and Lemeshow (1989). The data include information about factors related to low birth weight, which is an important concern due to its association with high infant mortality rates and birth defects.

The dataset includes the following variables:

- **ID**: Identification Code
- **lbw**: Low Birth Weight (0 = Birth Weight â‰¥ 2500g, 1 = Birth Weight < 2500g)
- **age**: Age of the Mother in Years
- **lwt**: Weight in Pounds at the Last Menstrual Period
- **ses**: Socio-Economic Status (1 = Low, 2 = Middle, 3 = High)
- **smoke**: Smoking Status During Pregnancy (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
- **ptl**: History of Premature Labor (0 = None, 1 = One, etc.)
- **hyper**: History of Hypertension (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
- **urirr**: Presence of Uterine Irritability (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
- **pvft**: Number of Physician Visits During the First Trimester (0 = None, 1 = One, 2 = Two, etc.)
- **bwt**: Birth Weight in Grams

## Exercise 1: Independent Samples t-Test in SPSS

### Objective

Compare birth weights between mothers who smoked during pregnancy and those who did not to determine if there is a significant difference.

### Graphical Exploration

To get a sense of the data and the extent of a possible effect of smoking, we start by creating a boxplot. In SPSS, this can be achieved by following these steps:

1. **Create Boxplot**: Go to `Graphs` > `Chart Builder`.
2. **Select Boxplot**: In the `Chart Builder`, select `Boxplot` from the gallery.
3. **Select Variables**: Drag `bwt` to the y-axis and `smoke` to the x-axis to create a boxplot comparing the birth weights for mothers who smoked and those who did not.
4. **Run the Graph**: Click `OK` to generate the boxplot.

::: {.callout-important icon=false title="Question"}
How do the spread, median, and potential outliers in the birth weight distributions compare between the two groups?
:::

### Analysis

1. **Perform the Test**: Go to `Analyze` > `Compare Means` > `Independent-Samples t Test`.
2. **Select Test Variable and Grouping Variable**: Move `bwt` to the `Test Variable` box and `smoke` to the `Grouping Variable` box.
3. **Define Groups**: Click on `Define Groups` and specify `0` and `1` for mothers who did not smoke and mothers who smoked, respectively.
4. **Run the Test**: Click `OK` to run the analysis.

### Output Interpretation

SPSS will generate several tables. Here we focus on the table **Independent Samples Test**, which includes:

- **Levene's Test for Equality of Variances**: Tests the assumption of equal variances between the two groups. The **F** and **Sig.** (p-value) columns represent the results of this test. If the **p-value** is greater than 0.05, the assumption of equal variances holds, and you should use the row labeled "Equal variances assumed" for interpreting the t-test results. If the **p-value** is less than or equal to 0.05, the assumption of equal variances is violated, and you should use the row labeled "Equal variances not assumed" for interpreting the t-test results.

- **t-test for Equality of Means**: Provides the t-test results, including the t-value, degrees of freedom, and p-value. It also includes the **Mean Difference** and **95% Confidence Interval of the Difference**. It is important to choose the appropriate row ("Equal variances assumed" or "Equal variances not assumed") based on the result of Levene's test.

::: {.callout-important icon=false title="Question"}
Based on the Levene's test, does the assumption of equal variances hold?
:::

::: {.callout-important icon=false title="Question"}
Is there a significant difference in birth weights between mothers who smoked and those who did not?
:::

### Model Diagnostics

To assess whether the assumption of normality holds for the outcome variable in both groups, follow these steps to create histograms:

1. **Create the Graph**: Go to `Graphs` > `Chart Builder`.
2. **Create Histogram**: In the `Chart Builder`, select `Histogram` from the gallery.
3. **Select Variables**: Drag `bwt` into the x-axis box.
4. **Split by Group**: In the `Chart Builder`, click on the `Groups/Points ID` tab. Check the `Rows panel variable` checkbox to add a panel field to the chart preview. Then, drag the `smoke` variable into this field to split the histograms by group.
5. **Run the Graph**: Click `OK` to generate the histograms.

::: {.callout-important icon=false title="Question"}
Do the histograms indicate that the birth weight data are approximately normally distributed for both groups?
:::

## Exercise 2: Mann-Whitney U Test in SPSS

### Objective

Compare the distributions of birth weights between mothers with and without a history of hypertension using a non-parametric test.

### Graphical Exploration

To get a sense of the data and the extent of a possible effect of hypertension, we start by creating a boxplot. In SPSS, this can be achieved by following these steps:

1. **Create Boxplot**: Go to `Graphs` > `Chart Builder`.
2. **Select Boxplot**: In the `Chart Builder`, select `Boxplot` from the gallery.
3. **Select Variables**: Drag `bwt` to the y-axis and `hyper` to the x-axis to create a boxplot comparing the birth weights for mothers with and without a history of hypertension.
4. **Run the Graph**: Click `OK` to generate the boxplot.
5. **Interpret the Graph**: Look at the spread, median, and potential outliers in the birth weight distributions for the two groups.

### Analysis

1. **Perform the Test**: Go to `Analyze` > `Nonparametric Tests` > `Independent Samples`.
2. **Move to the Fields Tab**: Click on the `Fields` tab.
3. **Select Test Variable and Grouping Variable**: Move `bwt` to the `Test Fields` box and `hyper` to the `Groups` box.
4. **Run the Analysis**: Click `Run` to perform the test.

### Output Interpretation

SPSS will generate several tables, including:

- **Ranks**: This table shows the mean rank for each group.
- **Test Statistics**: This table provides the Mann-Whitney U statistic and p-value.

::: {.callout-important icon=false title="Question"}
Which group has the higher median birth weight, based on the mean ranks?
:::

::: {.callout-important icon=false title="Question"}
Is there a significant difference in birth weights between mothers with and without a history of hypertension?
:::

## Exercise 3: One-Way ANOVA in SPSS

### Objective

Compare birth weights across different socio-economic status groups to determine if there is a significant difference in means.

### Graphical Exploration

To get a sense of the data and the potential differences among socio-economic status groups, we start by creating a boxplot. In SPSS, this can be achieved by following these steps:

1. **Create Boxplot**: Go to `Graphs` > `Chart Builder`.
2. **Select Boxplot**: In the `Chart Builder`, select `Boxplot` from the gallery.
3. **Select Variables**: Drag `bwt` to the y-axis and `ses` to the x-axis to create a boxplot comparing the birth weights for each socio-economic status group.
4. **Run the Graph**: Click `OK` to generate the boxplot.
5. **Interpret the Graph**: Look at the spread, median, and potential outliers in the birth weight distributions for each socio-economic status group.

### Analysis

1. **Perform the Test**: Go to `Analyze` > `Compare Means` > `One-Way ANOVA`.
2. **Select Variables**: Move `bwt` to the `Dependent List` and `ses` to the `Factor` box.
3. **Run the Analysis**: Click `OK` to run the ANOVA.

### Output Interpretation

SPSS will generate several tables, including:

- **Descriptives**: This table provides the mean, standard deviation, and sample size for each socio-economic status group.
- **ANOVA**: This table shows the F-statistic and p-value for the overall test.
- **Post-Hoc Tests**: If the ANOVA is significant, the post-hoc tests (e.g., Bonferroni) will help identify which groups differ.

::: {.callout-important icon=false title="Question"}
Is there a significant difference in birth weights across the socio-economic status groups?
:::

::: {.callout-important icon=false title="Question"}
Which socio-economic status groups show significant differences in birth weights?
:::

## Exercise 4: Kruskal-Wallis Test in SPSS (Non-Parametric Alternative to One-Way ANOVA)
