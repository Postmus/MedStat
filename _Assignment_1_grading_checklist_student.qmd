**Student:** _________________________ **Grade:** _____

### Scoring Convention

- **Excellent (10):** All required components are present and correct.
- **Good (8):** Everything essential is correct, with **one minor issue**.
- **Sufficient (6):** Core idea is present, but **multiple minor issues** or **one major issue**.
- **Insufficient (3):** Major parts are missing/incorrect, or results are not interpretable.

## Criterion 1: Selection of statistical tests and summary statistics (40%)

**Score:** ___ / 10

### RQ1 – ANOVA/Kruskal-Wallis

1. ☐ Boxplot comparing outcome across grouping variable categories
2. ☐ Normality assessed (Shapiro-Wilk, Q-Q plot, or visual inspection)
3. ☐ Equal variances assessed (Levene's test)
4. ☐ Correct test selected (ANOVA if assumptions met; Kruskal-Wallis if violated)
5. ☐ Post-hoc tests matching omnibus test (e.g., Dunn's test after Kruskal-Wallis, not t-tests)
6. ☐ Appropriate summary measures (Mean ± SD or Median (IQR))

### RQ2 – Chi-Square/Fisher's Exact

1. ☐ Correct test selected (Chi-Square if expected counts ≥ 5; Fisher's if < 5)
2. ☐ Prevalence calculated for each group
3. ☐ 95% CIs reported for prevalence estimates

### Baseline Characteristics Table

1. ☐ All variables included (except `target`)
2. ☐ Appropriate summary measures for continuous variables
3. ☐ Frequency counts and percentages for categorical variables

2. ☐ Tables and figures properly labeled
3. ☐ Report within 2–3 pages with professional formatting

**Comments:**
